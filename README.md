# LandChain with Stellar

## Overview
LandChain with Stellar is a blockchain-based smart contract system designed to digitize land ownership in rural Uganda. The platform aims to secure land records, automate transfers such as inheritance and leasing, and eliminate fraud through transparent and tamper-proof blockchain technology.

## Features
- **Immutable Land Records:** Once recorded, land data cannot be altered.
- **Smart Contracts:** Automate inheritance, leasing, and land transfers.
- **Digital Land Tokens:** Unique cryptographic tokens representing land plots linked to verified owners.
- **Mobile Access:** Accessible via smartphones or feature phones to ensure usability in rural areas.
- **Auditability:** Every transaction is transparent and verifiable on the blockchain.

## Problem Statement
In rural Uganda (Wakiso, Mukono, Luweero), land ownership is often informal, undocumented, or verbally transferred, leading to:
- Frequent disputes and conflicts.
- Land grabbing and fraud affecting vulnerable groups.
- Corruption and tampering in land offices.
- Lengthy and costly legal processes.
- Lack of transparency in leasing agreements.

## Solution
LandChain with Stellar uses blockchain and smart contracts to provide a secure, transparent, and automated land ownership and transfer system that addresses these challenges.

## Technologies
- Blockchain Platform: Stellar (with smart contract integration)
- Frontend: React / Flutter (TBD)
- Backend: Django.js / Express (TBD)
